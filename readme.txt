ABSTRACT
       
       The necessity for personal data protection has become increasingly important in recent years. The fingerprint is the most commonly used biometrics to verify a
userâ€™s identity for it being both unique and permanent throughout an individual's life. Fingerprint biometrics are extensively used by the forensic department in
criminal investigations and by governmental and private institutions for various sorts of personal (human) identification and verification.Accurately comparison of
contactless fingerprint images with contact-based fingerprints is critical for the success of emerging contactless fingerprint technologies.This offers more
hygienic and deformation-free acquisition of fingerprint features.This project aims to create a minutiae extraction fingerprint model based on Convolution Neural
Networks (CNN) as a quick and alternative method to fingerprint identification systems for Bank Transaction Process.Our approach introduces pre-processing
methods to capture regions of interest in fingerprint images to allow effective feature extraction. This determines the best CNN architecture that yields excellent
recognition performance, which is rapid and accurate in classification.
